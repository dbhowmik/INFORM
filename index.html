<h2 align=center>Tackling Food Waste and Malnutrition in Healthcare</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Every year, hospitals and healthcare facilities across the UK serve around <b>141 million meals</b>, but shockingly, up to <b>30 million</b> of these go uneaten. In NHS hospitals alone, as much as <b>18% of food</b> may end up wasted, which means roughly one in every six meals never reaches the people who need it.

<p>
This isnâ€™t just an issue of waste, itâ€™s about <b>people</b>. When nutritious food goes uneaten, patients miss out on vital nutrients that support their recovery, strength, and overall wellbeing. At the same time, throwing away uneaten meals has a serious environmental cost, contributing to carbon emissions and wasted resources.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, <b>malnutrition</b> remains a growing concern, especially among older adults. Over <b>160,000 people</b> aged 75 and over living in UK care homes are estimated to be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. The impact is far-reaching, malnutrition is already linked to around <b>15% of total health and social care spending</b>, as it leads to longer hospital stays, slower recovery, and greater pressure on services.

<p>
Our workshop brings together healthcare professionals, caterers, policymakers, and sustainability experts to explore how we can reduce food waste and improve nutrition across the care system. <b>Together</b>, we can create healthier, more <b>sustainable</b> healthcare environments, where every meal served truly <b>makes a difference</b>.
</p>

<p>
ðŸ‘‰ Join us for the <b>IN</b>telligent <b>FO</b>od <b>R</b>ecognition and <b>M</b>onitoring(<b>INFORM</b>) Workshop, a hands-on event designed to give participants a comprehensive understanding of the INFORM system, an innovative platform developed to address challenges like food waste, nutrition management, and operational efficiency in healthcare settings. Through interactive demonstrations and live case studies, the workshop will showcase INFORMâ€™s key features, practical applications, and the measurable benefits it can bring to hospitals, care homes, and other healthcare facilities.
